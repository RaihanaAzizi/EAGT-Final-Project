    <header><h1 align="center"> Their Stories Matter</h1></header>

    <p>Behind every statistic on child labor is a child with dreams, fears, and untold struggles. These are not just numbers on a report; they are real children forced to exchange their childhood for survival, carrying burdens far heavier than their small shoulders should bear. Instead of playing, learning, and growing in safe environments, they toil in factories, fields, and streets—often unseen, unheard, and forgotten by the world.  

    Their stories matter because they reveal the hidden faces behind this crisis. Every child who wakes up before dawn to work instead of going to school, every little hand that lifts heavy bricks instead of a pencil, and every young soul that has been robbed of laughter and innocence deserves to be heard. These are not just stories of suffering but also of resilience, strength, and the unbreakable spirit of children who refuse to give up, no matter how harsh their reality.  

    This page is dedicated to sharing their voices through real-life stories, powerful images, and glimpses into their daily struggles. With every picture, you will see the truth of their hardships, and with every story, you will feel the weight of their challenges. These are not fictional accounts—they are the lived experiences of children who need the world to see them, to hear them, and to fight for them.  

    By sharing their experiences, we are giving them a voice—one that has been silenced for too long. We are reminding the world that behind the clothes we wear, the products we buy, and the services we use, there may be a child laborer struggling to survive. These stories are a wake-up call, urging us to look beyond our comfort and recognize the injustice that continues to persist.  

    Awareness is the first step toward action. When we listen to these children, when we see their reality through images and words, we begin to understand the urgency of their situation. And with understanding comes the responsibility to act. No child should have to sacrifice their future for survival. Through these stories and images, we hope to ignite compassion, encourage advocacy, and inspire real solutions. Because every child deserves more than just survival—they deserve safety, education, and the freedom to dream. The question is: will we listen, and will we act?</p></div>

    <p class="caption"><b>1. Helal, the 10-Year-Old Brick Maker</b><br>

    Helal wakes up before sunrise to begin his long day at a brick kiln outside Kabul. His small hands are caked in mud as he carefully molds the heavy bricks, placing them in neat rows under the scorching sun. The work is exhausting, and the weight of the wet clay often leaves his arms sore and aching.

    Helal's family, like many others, relies on brick-making to survive. His father, also a laborer, cannot earn enough alone, so Helal must work alongside him instead of going to school. "I wish I could study like other children, but my family needs me here," he says. The kiln’s intense heat and dust make it difficult to breathe, and accidents are common. Despite the dangers, Helal has no choice—his family depends on every Afghan he earns.</p></br></div>

    <p class="caption"><b>2. Bilal, the Young Laborer in Sorkh Rod District
    </b><br>
    Bilal a boy from Nangarhar province, spends his days doing laborious work in Sorkh Rod district, where nearly 6,000 children are engaged in child labor. He carries heavy loads, works in fields, and sometimes helps at construction sites—all to support his struggling family.

    Unlike other children his age, Bilal has never held a pencil or sat in a classroom. He often watches schoolchildren pass by, their books in hand, and wonders what it would be like to learn. "I want to go to school, but there is no way," he says sadly. His family's financial hardship forces him to work from dawn until dusk. The labor is grueling, and he often returns home with bruised hands and blistered feet. Despite his exhaustion, Bilal still dreams of a future where he can study and build a better life.</p></br></div>

    <p class="caption"><b>3. Bushra, the Child Worker Deprived of Education</b><br>
    Bushra a young girl from Sorkh Rod district, spends her days working instead of attending school. While many of her friends have the chance to learn, she is forced to support her family. Every day, she helps with household chores, takes care of her younger siblings, and sometimes assists with labor-intensive work outside.

    She longs for an education but knows that poverty has left her with no choice. "I don’t have the opportunity to study. What can we do? It’s a necessity," she explains. At night, when the work is done, she sometimes finds an old book and tries to trace the letters with her fingers, imagining a life where she could read and write. But the cycle of poverty keeps her trapped, making education seem like a distant dream.</p></br></div>

    <p class="caption"><b>4. Dawatullah, the 16-Year-Old Shoe Factory Worker 
    Originally from Kunar province</b><br> 
    16-year-old Dawatullah has been working in a shoe factory in Kabul for the past six years. As the eldest child, he feels responsible for supporting his younger siblings and parents. His day begins at 4 a.m., and he works until 4 p.m., performing various tasks such as painting shoes, packaging them, and loading them onto trucks.

    The factory is filled with the strong smell of glue and chemicals, which often makes him feel dizzy. The long hours and repetitive work leave him exhausted, yet he continues because his family depends on him. "I don’t have time to rest or study. I must work," he says. Despite his situation, he still holds onto the hope that one day he might escape this life and find a way to get an education.

    <p class="caption"><b>5. Sidameer, the 10-Year-Old Block Maker
    In Nimroz province</b><br>
    10-year-old Sidameer and his brother wake up early every day to work in a block-making factory. The process is tough—lifting heavy cement blocks, arranging them properly, and ensuring they dry correctly. The work is dangerous, with dust filling the air and machines operating around them.

    Despite the risks, Sidameer has no choice but to work. His parents are sick, and the little money he earns—200 to 300 Afghanis a week—goes towards buying food and medicine. "I wish I could go to school, but my family needs me here," he says. His hands, rough and calloused from handling the cement, tell the story of a child forced to grow up too soon.

    <p class="caption"><b>6. Maryam, the Domestic Worker (Age 11)
    In a wealthy household in Kabul</b><br> 
    11-year-old Maryam wakes up before dawn to clean the floors, wash dishes, and prepare meals. Her employers expect perfection, and any mistake results in harsh words or even physical punishment. She rarely gets enough food, often surviving on leftovers. Maryam was sent to work as a domestic helper because her family was drowning in debt. She has not seen her parents in months, as she lives in her employer’s home. The other children in the house go to school, something Maryam can only dream of. Sometimes, she sneaks a glance at their books, tracing the letters with her fingers, wishing she could understand them. At night, she curls up on the cold floor, missing her family and wondering if she will ever be free. </p></br></div></div>
